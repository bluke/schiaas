\begin{abstract}
  In the  cloud computing  model, cloud providers  invoice clients  for resource
  consumption. Hence, tools helping the client to budget the cost of running his
  application are  of pre-eminent  importance. To  that end,  a number  of cloud
  simulators have been  proposed by researchers. However, the  attempts to reach
  reliable  predictions are  hampered by  the opacity  regarding the  underlying
  hardware platform  and the  multi-tenant nature  clouds make job
  runtimes both  variable and hard to  predict.  In this paper,  we investigate
  through two real  use-cases, which parameters are the most  influential in the
  prediction of the actual execution behavior in terms of cost and makespan.

  We consider the execution  of batch jobs on an  actual platform, one example
  being a  bag-of-tasks and the other  one a workflow, whose  jobs are scheduled
  using typical  heuristics based on  the user  estimates of job  runtimes.  We
  propose an  improved simulation framework  based on the Monte-Carlo  method to
  study the  relationship between the  precision of  the user estimates  and the
  accuracy of the simulation results regarding  cost and makespan. Based on this
  stochastic process,  predictions are expressed as  interval-based makespan and
  cost.   We show  that  most  of the time imprecisions  in  user estimates are
  largely amortized in the final predictions but still can capture real
  observations. Finally, we offer evidence of the influence of the scheduling 
  heuristics on the accuracy of the method.

\section{Introduction.}


Over the last decade, the advancement  of virtualization techniques has  led to
the emergence of new economic and exploitation approaches of computer resources in
the form of \ac{iaas}, one form of cloud computing. In this model, all computing
resources are made available on demand  by third-party operators and paid based
on usage.   The ability to provision  resources on demand provided  by \ac{iaas}
operators is mainly  used in two ways.  Firstly, for  scaling purposes where new
machines  are brought  online to  fulfill service  availability in  the face  of
higher loads, this approach is used for providing service and allows for a lower
baseline cost while still being able to deal with spikes in demand by provisioning
machines  on  the fly. Secondly, for  parallelizing  tasks to  achieve  shorter
makespan at  equal cost,  this approach  is used  for scientific  and industrial
workloads with a clear goal and  where runtime is heavily  dependent on computing
power.   This  approach  is  made  possible   by  the  pricing  model  of  cloud
infrastructures, as  popularized by  AWS\footnote{Amazon Web Services},  in which
payment  for computing  power, provided  as  \acp{vm}, happens  in increments of
arbitrary lengths of time, \ac{btu},  usually of  one hour. Running  two \ac{vm}
side by side for one \ac{btu} each costs the same as running one \ac{vm} for two
\ac{btu}, but every \ac{btu} started is owed in full.

This model  offers the client  an almost complete freedom  to start or  stop new
servers as  long as the  price can be  afforded. However, for  complex workloads
composed of a number of potentially  dependent jobs it becomes quickly difficult
to manually provision the resources and the use of a scheduler is unavoidable.
 
In this paper,  we are interested in  predicting the execution time  and cost of
such complex workloads, in which the scheduling plays an important role. In this
study,  we consider  two opposite  scheduling  strategies to  put forward  their
impact on execution behavior. We will review in the related work section several
other scheduling approaches.


%----------------------- prediction tools --------------------------------------
Independently of  scheduling decisions,  accurate prediction  of the  runtime of
complex workloads is hampered by  multiple factors.  First \ac{iaas} operates in
a opaque fashion,  the exact nature of the underlying  platforms are unknown and
may  slightly vary  for a  given type  of resource  as operators  complete their
data-centers  over the  years with  new servers  and equipment.   Secondly cloud
systems are multi-tenant  by nature which adds uncertainty due  to contention on
network and  memory accesses,  depending on  how \ac{vm}  are scheduled  and the
activity of  your \emph{neighbors}.   Even when  \ac{iaas} operators  attempt to
mask these irregularities in computing  power and network access by guaranteeing
a    minimum     performance,    variability     occurs    in     presence    of
\emph{less-than-noisy-neighbors} as it  is not in the interest  of the \ac{iaas}
operators to limit power available  over the guaranteed minimums.  These factors
add to the already high difficulty of  modeling job execution times on a network
of computers as shown in~\cite{Lastovetsky05}.

In this regard,  the prediction is highly dependent on  the underlying simulator
of the system and on the phenomena it  can capture. In this work, we rely on the
SimGrid~\cite{simgrid}  simulation toolkit,  enabling  to  build discrete  event
simulators of distributed systems such as Grids, Clouds, or HPC systems. SimGrid
has   been    chosen   for    its   well-studied   accuracy    against   reality
(e.g~\cite{StanisicTLVM15,VelhoSCL13}).    In   particular,  given   a   precise
description  of the  hardware platform,  its  network model  takes into  account
network contention in presence of multiple  communication flows and can model VM
boot times.

However, we may not be able to provide a fully accurate platform description, or
unable  to estimate  the network  cross-traffic, yielding  a distorsion  between
simulation and reality.  To deal with this problem, the  standard approach is to
consider job runtimes to  be stochastic.  Every job can be  modeled by a \ac{rv}
that models the whole spectrum of possible runtimes. These \ac{rv} are the basis
required for a stochastic simulation.  Such simulations output a random variable
of the  observed phenomenon (\emph{makespan}  or \emph{\ac{btu}}) which  in turn
can  be  used to  create  intervals  of  possible  results with  their  assorted
confidence.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic method to enrich the classical prediction
based  on the  discrete-event simulator  SimGrid,  and we  study the  conditions
needed for  this approach to be  relevant. This study  is carried out in  a real
setting,  described in  section~\ref{sec:work-context},  where the  applications
use-cases, the scheduler, and the  experimental observations are presented.  The
stochastic     framework     we     propose     is     then     presented     in
section~\ref{sec:enriched-sim}  and is  evaluated in  section~\ref{sec:eval}. We
finally conclude by  discussing the possible improvements and the  limits of the
approach.

\subsection{Scheduling}
\textbf{FIXME: chapeau et transition~?}
%----------------------- scheduling approaches ---------------------------------
Compared to earlier distributed computing systems (e.g Grids), the scheduling
problem statement in the cloud must be reformulated because of two fundamental
novelties: firstly the size of the infrastructure can be dynamically scaled, and
secondly as economic cost can be clearly measured, it naturally becomes an
additional objective to the traditional makespan objective, making the problem
multi-objective. An abundance of heuristics have been developed to adapt to the
cloud context, spanning a large variety of assumptions about the setup. The
bi-objective issue is often tackled by combining the cost and makespan metrics
in a single one or fixing one parameter as a constraint (deadline- or budget-
constrained schedules). While it can be argued that several solutions may be
equally interesting trade-offs, it is up to the user to choose. In~\cite{Su13}
is proposed a strategy where VMs belonging to a Pareto front representing the
most cost-efficient resources are used in priority to map jobs. Likewise,
in~\cite{Durillo14} a set of Pareto-optimal solutions are proposed to the user,
and this is also the spirit of our own work. Another discriminating criterion
between approaches is the assumption of an \emph{online} (or
\emph{just-in-time}) or \emph{offline} (or \emph{static}) schedule, on the type
of workload (independent jobs or workflows), the homogeneity of the resources,
or the way they handle the multiple objectives. Offline scheduling represents a
large body of the research often based on the adaptation of popular heuristics
aiming to minimize makespan in Grids. For instance the popular
HEFT~\cite{Zhao2003} heuristic has been revisited in~\cite{LinL11}, which adds
the ability to scale resources depending on whether or not a task can execute by
its estimated finish time, or as extended in~\cite{Li11cost-conscious} to select
slots with a balance between runtime and cost. However, offline scheduling is
often evaluated through simulation while online scheduling is closer to the
practitioners assumptions who evaluate their ideas in actual environments.
Online strategies have been proposed for bags-of-tasks, to address the problem
of appropriately provisioning the platform
(e.g~\cite{MarshallKF10,GenaudG11,DuongLG11,VillegasASI12}). These works share
many commonalities, especially taking into account some important operating
system level details, such as the boot time of a VM or the contention that
occurs if too many VMs are started simultaneously. 

% TODO explain  how scheduling gets in the way of simulation
\subsection{Simulation}

Because they allow for experiments on functionality without having to build a
dedicated platform, simulations are a cornerstone of the study of distributed
systems and clouds.  

Most cloud simulator are based on \ac{des}. In \aclp{des} the simulation is a
series of events changing the state of the simulated system. Events can be the
start (or end) of a computation, the change of state of a machine, or
disconnection of a network. The simulator will jump from one event to the next
updating the times of upcoming events to reflect the change of state in the
simulations. Such \ac{des} based simulators require at least a platform
specification and an application description. The platform specification
describes both the physical nature of the cloud, e.g.~machines and networks, and
the logical part of the clouds, e.g.~\ac{vm} placement and availability.
Depending on the simulator, platform specification can be done through user
code, as in CloudSim\cite{cloudsim} for example, or through platform description
files, as is mostly the case in SimGrid\cite{simgrid}. The application is the
series of events happening during the simulation. Although the application is
the active payload of the simulation it is not always what is being observed by
the experimenter.  Application are sometimes just the backdrop against which we
study specific cloud components,%e.g.~someone interested in testing new \ac{vm}
%placement algorithms will be simulating the same application multiple times
%while changing the platform specification.
Application description can vary
widely between simulators. The most common description is a user code that uses
simulation primitives to trigger events. Simgrid\cite{simgrid} can also take as
application description MPI traces, from which it will derive a sequence of
events, or a \acl*{dag} abstracting the application.

The model is the internal logic of the simulator it takes the states of the
system generated by the platform and previous events to solve the timing of the
future events, therefore allowing the simulation to know to which event to jump
next. In most cases simulators have a \emph{bottom-up} approach based on the
modeling of low level components (machines, networks, storage devices), and
large scale behaviours emerges naturally from the interactions of these
components. Working on disjointed low level components make it easier to tune
the precision of the model to the wanted accuracy/speed trade-off. The models
used is usually discriminating factor between two simulators of equal
functionality.

commons cloud simulators.

In the context  of cloud computing where  execution is subject not  only to it's
inherent variability but also matters  of memory and network contention. Because
of the existence of  so many sources of variability, the  sequence of events for
completing an application  execution might not be  the same from one  run to the
other. As  such a deterministic  simulation will not  produce a results  that it
correct for  every run.  Stochastic  simulations aim to integrate  this inherent
variability by considering the full array  of possible runtimes and outputting a
distribution of possible outcomes.

\subsection{Monte-Carlo Method}

Stochastic  simulations are  computationally more  expensive than  deterministic
ones. In stochastic simulations inputs  become random variables representing the
distribution of possible values for the parameters. In the context of stochastic
\ac{dag} it has  been shown that computing the  makespan distribution requires
multiple derivations and  integrations~\cite{Ludwig01,Li97}. Monte Carlo methods
allow us to side step these computational difficulties. This method was proposed
for PERT  graphs in 1967~\cite{Slyke63}, and  in the recent year  in the context
\ac{dag} scheduling~\cite{Canon10,Zheng13}.

\aclp{mcs} (\acs{mcs})\acused{mcs}  work by  repeatedly drawing  input variables
and using  them in deterministic simulations  to obtain samples of  the possible
results. Once enough samples have been computed, traditional fitting can be used
to characterize the resulting random variable.  In our case, we will draw values
of  the  effective runtimes  of  the  individual  jobs,  and we  obtain  through
simulation samples of makespans and BTU counts.

We  present  hereafter  our  experimental   setup.   It  consists  of  two  test
applications, which are run  on one side, on a real  platform with our scheduler
Schlouder and on  the other side, are simulated with  our simulator SimSchlouder
based on SimGrid.

 
\subsection{Real Execution Setup}
In the recent years, we have developed  a client-side job broker for IaaS clouds
called Schlouder~\cite{Michon17}.  This broker is  able to submit on  the user's
batch jobs, be  it a set of  independent jobs or a workflow.   The broker's main
role is  to schedule the set  of jobs onto a  set of cloud resources,  which the
broker can scale up  or down depending on a \emph{strategy}  chosen by the user.
Technically, the broker  connects to the cloud management  system (for instance,
OpenStack) to  instruct how  the infrastructure should  be provisioned  and then
assigns the jobs to the resources using the Slurm job management system.

Applications are submitted to Schlouder as batch jobs. Each job is provided with
a \emph{user estimate} of the runtime, and if the application is a workflow, the
list  of dependencies.  Schlouder uses  just-in-time scheduling  where jobs  are
assigned to \acp{vm}  as soon as all their dependencies  are satisfied.  We call
\emph{strategy}  the  heuristic  used  by Schlouder  to  make  provisioning  and
scheduling decisions.   A dozen strategies  and their variants are  available to
the user (details can be found in~\cite{GenaudG11}), of which we will use two in
this paper.  Strategies provision \acp{vm} and  schedule jobs based on  the user
estimates  of  the  runtime.  Notice   that  the  jobs'  real  runtimes,  called
\emph{effective  runtimes}, may  differ from  the estimates,  but this  does not
change the initial scheduling decision with  regards to which resources the jobs
are assigned.

As mentioned  in introduction,  as no  one solution dominates  the other  in all
objectives, we leave  it to the user  the choice of strategies  which will favor
one  or the  other  objective  (cost or  makespan).  These  two main  strategies
proposed by Schlouder are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ASAP (or \textit{as soon as possible}): schedules the job immediately onto
  an idle VM, or immediately provisions a new VM to start the job if no idle VM 
  is available.  Hence this strategy tries to minimize the makespan
  of the batch job execution.

\item AFAP (or \textit{as full as  possible}): schedules each job in priority to
	an already available resource whenever the remaining time  before a new
	\ac{btu} begins is greater or equal to the job estimated runtime.
	By solving this bin-packing problem, this strategy tends to minimize the
	monetary cost of the batch execution.
\end{itemize}
In the following,  we will evaluate the real executions  against the backdrop of
these two strategies.




\subsection{Simulated Execution Setup}
As a follow-up  to our work on Schlouder we  developed SimSchlouder, a simulator
reimplementing the  behaviour of Schlouder, and  relying on SimGrid as  its core
simulation engine.  This simulator allows the user to request an estimate of the
makespan and  the cost before choosing  a strategy for a  real run. SimSchlouder
includes the same strategies as Schlouder,  and as its real-world counterpart it
is easily extendable with new strategies. 

For the purpose of this paper, we classify the inputs required by SimSchlouder
in two categories. The first category is the operator inputs, which describe the
hardware platform and the cloud configuration. Internally, they are fed to the
SimGrid core and the \ac{iaas} simulation layer. The second category is the end
user inputs. They describe the workflow to simulate, the submission dates of
each job, the runtime prediction that would be provided to Schlouder.
Additionally for the purpose of the simulator, a user can choose to supply
effective runtimes to match, communication to simulate, or alternative boot
times for the \acp{vm}. These additional inputs are used to alter the sequence
of events simulated without interfering with parameters that would change the
provisioning or scheduling decisions made by SimSchlouder, e.g.\ having a job
overrun its runtime without changing the corresponding user prediction.

As mentioned above, the variability of real executions suggests that a simulation,
even if it was  perfectly accurate, would capture only one of the set
of possible real executions. We will show later that  the simulation is indeed
very   accurate  when   the  user   estimates  are   close  to   the  effective
runtimes. However,  to  provide the user  with a broader view  of how
their real executions could behave with job runtimes variability,  we should 
enrich the simulation framework with some form of stochastic prediction.

\subsection{Test Applications}\label{sc:setup}

To evaluate Schlouder performance we carried out multiple executions of
typical scientific applications. The execution traces for those runs were
collected in an archive. This backlog of real executions is the benchmark
against which our simulation performance will be evaluated. The applications
used are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Montage\cite{montage2009}, the Montage Astronomical Image Mosaic
		Engine, is designed to splice astronomical images. The structure
                of this application is a fork-join type workflow. This
                application  is extremely data intensive with a
		\emph{commuication-to-computation} ratio superior to $90\%$.
	\item OMSSA\cite{Geer2004}, the Open Mass-Spectrometry Search Algorithm, 
		is used to analyze mass-spectrometer results. The application is
                parallelized as a bag-of-tasks, \textit{i.e.} as a number of
                independent parallel jobs. This application is
		computation intensive with a
		\emph{communication-to-computation} ratio under $20\%$.
\end{itemize}

\end{comment}

These two applications were executed using Schlouder on a private cloud.  We set
up a 96 core cloud based on four identical  dual $2.67GHz$ Intel Xeon X5650
servers with KVM-based virtualization  and an Openstack cloud-front (first
2012.1, and later 2014.2). This cluster was exclusively used by us and special
attention was taken to never overload the system.

\subsection{MCS}


%\paragraph{Method} 
Consider an  application consisting of  $n$ jobs,  independent or organized  as a
workflow.  The simulation engine SimSchlouder  takes as input the user estimates
$T_1, \ldots , T_n$ for the job runtimes, schedules the jobs and finally outputs
the makespan $M$ of the whole batch.  The user estimates might be inaccurate
and  we describe  hereafter  a method  to characterize  the  impact of  repeated
imprecisions (on each  job runtime) on the final makespan.   We have developed a
\ac{mcs} tool to  compute a confidence interval around the  makespan produced by
simulation.  Let us sketch the overall process (see Fig~\ref{fig:mc-process}):
\begin{itemize} 
\item from  the set of  specified runtimes  $\{T_i\}$, the system  generates $s$
  sets  of perturbed  runtimes $\{T_i^1\},  \ldots, \{T_i^s\}$.   Each perturbed
  runtime  is a  random  value  uniformly drawn  around  $T_i$  (to be explained
  below). We call \emph{realisation} each such random draw of a set of perturbed
  runtimes.
\item a simulation  is run for each realisation, producing  a makespan $M^i$ and
  BTU count sample for each,
\item a  normal distribution ${\cal  N}(\mu,\sigma)$ is fitted on  the different
  makespan values.
\end{itemize}

runtime set, every simulation is then simulated, the resulting makespan
samples are fitted into the final result.}\label{fig:mc-process}
\end{figure}
Fitting is done to a normal distribution because, in essence the makespan is the
sum  of the  runtimes of  the jobs  on the  critical path  of the  schedule.  To
measure the impact  of the runtime perturbation on the  makespan, we compute the
range $[\mu-2\sigma;\mu+2\sigma]$ (that is  a 95\% confidence interval) relative
to  the mean  $\mu$.

\subsection{Experimental Observations}

Schlouder execution traces contain several useful metrics including, but not
limited to, the \ac{vm} start dates, boot time, shutdown times, and assigned
tasks, as well as the task start date and effective runtimes. We are interested in
two macro metrics, the makespan and the cost.  The makespan is the time elapsed
between the submission of the first job and the completion of the last completed
job. The cost is measured as a number of \acp{btu}. Since our experiments have a
single \ac{vm} type we counted one \ac{btu} per \ac{vm} per started hour to
match the most common pricing on the cloud. Table~\ref{tab:nbruns} gives an
overview of the executions in the archive used in this paper. We observe
variability on the makespan due to the variability of individual job effective
runtime.

Figure~\ref{fig:realbrs}  presents the  distribution of  makespans and  \ac{btu}
counts over  more than  200 runs in all. Makespan distribution is represented
using an density curve, by definition these curves have an integral equal to 1.
These figures expose the  behaviour exhibited  by the
different strategies. ASAP  appears to finish faster in the  most cases and AFAP
is less costly. But  these optimizations come at the cost  of instability on the
dimension they  aim to  optimize. ASAP uses  a high number  of \ac{btu}s  but this
number is stable, whereas AFAP uses a lower number of \ac{btu}s  
but this number of \ac{btu}s is  more variable.  When
looking at the makespan, we take note of how the different strategies affect the
skewness of  the overall distribution. The  positive skew seen on  ASAP suggests
that even though  the strategy globally produces  shorter makespan, perturbations
are more likely  to extend the makespan, whereas AFAP  makespans are more spread
out and skews negatively.


All the behaviours discussed in this section are due to the specifics of the
provisioning and scheduling strategies. In the case of AFAP and ASAP a thorough
analysis could probably expose the strategies' instabilities, but that would not
be possible on more complex and dynamic strategies. In the following sections we
choose to consider strategies as black boxes to show that through simulation 
we are able  to obtain an accurate prediction of our runs' distribution
and of our strategies' biases.


\subsection{Input Modeling}\label{sec:im}

Core  to the  \acl{mcs} is  the accuracy  of our  job runtimes  inputs. Given  a
precise simulator and enough samples, the \ac{mcs} will return a precise result,
but this  result corresponds to  the reality described  by the inputs.  In other
words, for the result to be a good  predictor of the reality, the inputs must be
a good descriptor of reality.

Hence, we seek  to determine which is  the range of acceptable  input values for
the  \ac{mcs} to  produce accurate  enough predictions  (in terms  of confidence
interval),  and we call this  search \emph{input  modeling}.  Answering  this
question will tell us the  acceptable margin of error in the  user estimate for the
method to be relevant.
An ideal  model would present  an individual distribution  for every job  in the
workflow, and such a distribution would require a deep understanding of the jobs
computation, communication, and  of the underlying platform.  In  real life such
modeling  is not  practical  as the  underlying platform  is  usually not
precisely  known, and  the user might not be very familiar with the application.
For this reason, despite having a comprehensive archive ourselves, we choose to 
use a more generic model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:MCS}, for the purpose of our \ac{mcs} we
consider job runtimes as a base runtime on which a perturbation is applied. The
extent of this perturbation is called the \emph{perturbation level} and is
denoted $P$. Though the base is determined job per job, the perturbation level
is set simulation wide. We set the effective runtime of a job $i$ within the
$n$\textit{-th} simulation of an \ac{mcs} to: 
\begin{equation}
	T_i^n = T_i * (1+r_i^n)
\end{equation}
with $r_i^n$ the perturbation value drawn between $[-P;+P]$.

As we  will see  in Section~\ref{sec:sa},  the parameters $T_i$  and $P$  have a
great influence on the \ac{mcs} results.  Our findings are that the best results
are obtained by  taking as $T_i$ the average effective  runtime observed for job
$i$ for a given  strategy. This corresponds to the guess of a knowledgable user.
Regarding  the simulation  wide perturbation level  $P$, we found  that the best
setting  is the average  of the worst relative deviations for all jobs in the
workload:
\begin{equation}
P = \underset{i}{\textrm{mean}}(\delta{}_i)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta{}_i =
\max_n\left(\frac{R_i^n-\textrm{mean}(R_i)}{\textrm{mean}(R_i)}\right)
\end{equation}
with $R_i^n$ the observed effective runtime for job $i$ during execution $n$. 

For OMSSA, the perturbation level given by this methods is roughly 10\% for both
strategies. For Montage  our calculated perturbation level is  20\% when looking
at ASAP  executions and  5\% when  looking at AFAP  executions. We  believe this
difference can be partially  explained by the low number of  montage runs in the
archive. As such we additionally ran a Montage simulation using the 10\% 
perturbation level calculated using the OMSSA executions.

For  each  application and  strategy  we  also  perform a  single  deterministic
simulation  using the  raw base  value  with 0\%  perturbation. This  simulation
serves as  reference when  evaluating the strategies' behaviour when  faced with
perturbations.

\subsection{Prediction Quality}\label{sec:pq}

We evaluate the  validity of our simulation based on  two different factors, the
\emph{makespan capture  rate} and  the \emph{BTU capture rate}.   The makespan
capture rate is the percentage of  real makespans which fall into the confidence
interval generated by fitting the  makespans of our individual simulations using
a Normal distribution, as  discussed in Section~\ref{sec:MCS}.  Unless otherwise
specified we  use a standard 95\%  confidence interval of width  $4\sigma$.  BTU
capture rate is the ratio of BTU counts found in the simulation to the BTU
counts observed  during our  real runs.  Figure~\ref{fig:fit} shows  results for
\acp{mcs} using  the input  model presented  in the previous  section at  a 10\%
perturbation level.

Table~\ref{tab:fit}  summarizes the  results obtained  with a  10\% perturbation
level. Along with the makespan capture rates included in parenthesis is the size
of the confidence interval relative to  the average makespan.  With our model we
are able to  capture 90\% of real executions  in ASAP and 92\% of  real AFAP run
for OMSSA\@.  These intervals  span 7  and 10  minutes respectively  whereas the
results in our archive  spread over 10 and 11 minutes.   Using a 99\% confidence
interval results in  better capture rates of  100\% for AFAP and  98\% for ASAP,
but also  in wider intervals  of 15 minutes.  Such  an interval increase  may be
seen as having little impact, like in  our OMSSA use-case exhibiting 3 to 4 hour
runs. Probably this choice of the confidence interval is best left to the user.

For cost prediction our enriched  simulation finds exactly the same possibilities
as experienced in reality, though in  the case of AFAP, repartition favors higher
BTU counts, slightly more than observed in our backlog.

Working on Montage when using \acp{mcs} with the perturbation level of its
respective strategy, as seen in Section~\ref{sec:im}, the capture rate is 100\%
across all strategies. This capture rate is maintained when using the 10\%
perturbation obtained using the OMSSA archive. In this cases the intervals span
from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes for AFAP and ASAP respectively on workflow lasting from
47 and 25 minutes respectively. Because Montage runs in less than 1 hour BTU 
counts are naturally stable, which is perfectly assessed by our simulations.

The results shown in  this section show that provided a  good description of job
runtimes our simulator will provide  good predictions of the possible executions
of these runs. However, though we strived to keep our input modeling as simple
as possible, the  benefits of hindsight provided by the  archive means that only
the users most knowledgeable about their  workload and the targeted platform can
hope to achieve such predictions.  In Section~\ref{sec:lim}, we will discuss the
limits we experienced with this approach. In the next section we show by comparing
different \acp{mcs}  that we are able  to study the behavior  of the strategies
when confronted with different applications and perturbation levels.


\subsection{Strategy analysis}\label{sec:sa}

In our method the perturbation is meant to capture all sources of uncertainties
that could affect a job runtime, noisy neighbors, memory access contention,
cache misses, or even variations in the underlying platform. This has allowed us
to bring all these uncertainties under one dimension, but it should be noted that
we could achieve similar results by having a different \ac{mcs}, draw different values
of network bandwidth, cpu-speed, or any other uncertain parameters for each
individual simulation. Our one-dimensional approach is much easier to implement
but at the cost of making the perturbation level more difficult to construct.

In this section we  continue to base our user estimates  on the average runtimes
of the  jobs, as a  knowledgable user  would, but consider  that we do  not know
which perturbation  level is appropriate for the given platform  and application
strategy.   In such  a  situation a  user  would be  interested  in testing  his
application with different perturbation levels.

Figure~\ref{fig:int} presents  the results  of such simulations  for a  10\% and
40\% perturbation level.  On the  makespan interval graphs (left subfigures) the
boxes represent the span  of the capture interval and the  crossbar inside a box
represents   a   single   0\%   perturbation  simulations   done   outside   the
\ac{mcs}. Comparing  the interval  of perturbed  simulation to  this unperturbed
simulation allows us to view the effect  of perturbation on the strategy. In the
middle of these subfigures,  are presented  for  reference the  interval 
spanning  the minimum and maximum observed makespans over all runs.

These effects are most noticeable in the leftmost graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:int}
showing the makespan intervals obtained for OMSSA at 40\% and 10\% perturbation
levels. With the increase of the perturbation level the intervals naturally get 
wider, but the average makespan, by definition the center of the capture 
interval, also gets higher. On OMSSA this happens to the extent that the lower 
bound of our interval at 40\% is higher than the lower bound at 10\%.
This shows that ASAP, a strategy geared towards reducing the makespan regardless
of cost, is not as effective when scheduling bag-of-tasks in environments where
job runtimes might vary widely.  This is also true to a certain extent when
scheduling workflows. As seen in the third graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:int} the
average runtime for Montage also increases slightly with the perturbation level.

When looking at cost, these simulations show that with AFAP, as
perturbation level increases, low BTU count runs become less likely to occur and
higher BTU counts become possible. This is not the case for ASAP, or in a 
context where the application run is clearly under an hour.

This approach to analyzing strategies and their interactions with workflow has
the notable advantage of not requiring complete understanding of a strategy, as
long as a correct implementation of the strategy is available in the simulator,
it can be considered a black box. The enriched simulation allows the user to
witness its behavior against any workflow or variability.


\subsection{Advantages and limitations of the enriched simulation}\label{sec:lim}

Thanks to our backlog of executions, we were able to build a trustworthy model
of how the applications behaved on our platform. Our ability to check repeatedly
our simulation against reality has allowed us to test multiple ways to model 
our inputs and multiple options on what to simulate. 

First we found that  for our purposes the \ac{mcs} did  not require thousands of
deterministic simulations to  be successful. When used in other  domains such as
physics \acp{mcs} are often used with up from 20\,000 deterministic simulations,
but  the size  of the  input  distribution is  usually much  larger. The  result
presented  in this  paper were obtained using  500 simulations per \ac{mcs}.  By
keeping  the results  of the  individual simulations  ordered, we  were able  to
determine  that by  the hundredth  simulation the  average makespan  was already
precise to the second, with its value hardly changing by the addition of the 400
next  simulations. The  standard  deviation used  to compute  the  width of  the
makespan interval was less stable, but still showed strongly diminishing returns
past the 100th simulation mark.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:MCS}, \aclp{mcs} replace a stochastic
simulation by repeated execution of deterministic simulations of the same
phenomenon on random samples of the possible inputs. It is critical that the
operator inputs to the simulation be correct within the deterministic simulations.
This includes for example the correct simulation of boot times, and correct
reimplementation of strategies. Ideally, the deterministic simulator is able to
properly reproduce real runs when fed with all the relevant information. In cases
where some external parameter is also unstable or unpredictable, it can also be
made part of the \ac{mcs} to be randomly drawn at each iteration.

Increasing the perturbation level will not always increase the prediction's
capture rate. To illustrate this we added the intervals of observed real
makespans to the relevant graphs in Figure~\ref{fig:int}. On the OMSSA/ASAP
makespan interval graph we can see that as the perturbation level gets higher
the enriched simulation resulting interval wider, but not as fast as the
average makespan gets higher. This leads to a lower capture rate with the 40\%
perturbation level, 83\% capture, than with 10\% perturbation level 90\%,
despite presenting a much wider interval. In reality the perturbation level of
our system is not close to 40\%, therefore a \ac{mcs} with this level of
perturbation can not be a good predictor of reality. Such a simulation would be
a predictor of an alternate reality where this level of perturbation exists. As
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:pq}, trade-off between the capture rate and
makespan interval is still possible by using a different confidence
interval after fitting the simulated makespan to a Normal distribution.




\section{Conclusion}

Predicting  the execution  behavior  of complex  workloads in  the  cloud is  an
important challenge. While a number of research works have proposed model-driven
simulators, much remains to be done for their adoption in production-grade cloud
settings. As  advocated by Puchert  et al.~\cite{PucherGWK15}, the trust  we can
put in  the prediction  demands certainty  and precision  that only  comes from
validating simulation against empirical observation.

This paper contributes to this effort in two ways. First, we propose a
\acl{mcs} extension to a discrete event simulator based on SimGrid. This
extension provides stochastic predictions which are more informative than single
values of cost and makespan. Second, we apply our method in a real setting,
on both a bag-of-tasks and a workflow application for which we have collected
execution traces. Our study puts forward the conditions for the applicability of
the method, especially regarding the impact of the initial user estimates of the
jobs' runtimes, which are central to any scheduling process. The first
perspective of this work is to apply the method to production clouds. In this
paper we managed to aggregate all the different sources of uncertainty into a
perturbation on the job's runtime. We are interested in checking whether this is
still possible in highly variable environments. Our second perspective, now that
we are confident in our ability to simulate application executions, is to move
away from the applications in our archive and use our enriched simulation to
study the interactions between scheduling and workflow. More specifically, we
are interested in how the structure of a workflow affects a scheduling's
robustness, that is, its ability to satisfy predetermined constraints in terms of
deadline or cost.
