\begin{abstract}
  In the  cloud computing  model, cloud providers  invoice clients  for resource
  consumption. Hence, tools helping the client to budget the cost of running his
  application are  of pre-eminent  importance. To  that end,  a number  of cloud
  simulators have been  proposed by researchers. However, the  attempts to reach
  reliable  predictions are  hampered by  the opacity  regarding the  underlying
  hardware platform  and the  multi-tenant nature  clouds make job
  runtimes both  variable and hard to  predict.  In this paper,  we investigate
  through two real  use-cases, which parameters are the most  influential in the
  prediction of the actual execution behavior in terms of cost and makespan.

  We consider the execution  of batch jobs on an  actual platform, one example
  being a  bag-of-tasks and the other  one a workflow, whose  jobs are scheduled
  using typical  heuristics based on  the user  estimates of job  runtimes.  We
  propose an  improved simulation framework  based on the Monte-Carlo  method to
  study the  relationship between the  precision of  the user estimates  and the
  accuracy of the simulation results regarding  cost and makespan. Based on this
  stochastic process,  predictions are expressed as  interval-based makespan and
  cost.   We show  that  most  of the time imprecisions  in  user estimates are
  largely amortized in the final predictions but still can capture real
  observations. Finally, we offer evidence of the influence of the scheduling 
  heuristics on the accuracy of the method.

\section{Introduction.}


Over the  last decade, the advancement  of virtualization techniques has  led to
the emergence of new economic  and exploitation approaches of computer resources
in  the form  of \ac{iaas},  one form  of cloud  computing. In  this model,  all
computing resources  are made available  on demand by third-party  operators and
paid based  on usage.  The  ability to provision  resources on demand  is mainly
used in two ways.  Firstly, it can serve for scaling purposes where new machines
are  brought online  to  fulfill  service availability  in  the  face of  higher
loads.  This approach  is used  for  providing service  and allows  for a  lower
baseline  cost  while  still  being  able  to deal  with  spikes  in  demand  by
provisioning machines on the fly. Secondly, it is useful for parallelizing tasks
to achieve a  shorter makespan (i.e the total execution  execution time from the
first  to the  last task)  at equal  cost, this  approach being  often used  for
scientific  and  industrial  workloads  when runtime  is  heavily  dependent  on
computing power.  This  approach is made possible by the  pricing model of cloud
infrastructures, as  popularized by AWS\footnote{Amazon Web  Services}, in which
payment  for computing  power, provided  as \acp{vm},  happens in  increments of
arbitrary lengths  of time, \ac{btu}, usually  of one hour. Running  two \ac{vm}
side by side for one \ac{btu} each costs the same as running one \ac{vm} for two
\ac{btu}, but every \ac{btu} started is owed in full.

This model  offers the client  an almost complete freedom  to start or  stop new
servers as  long as  the price  can be  afforded. However,  running applications
composed of  a set of  jobs, that  can be parallel  or dependent on  some others
(generally a \ac{dag}  of jobs) quickly becomes difficult  to manually provision
the resources  in an efficient way.  The use of a  scheduler becomes unavoidable
for  such  workloads.  In  this  paper,  we  are  interested in  predicting  the
execution time and cost of such complex workloads, in which the scheduling plays
an  important  role.   In  this  study,  we  consider  two  opposite  scheduling
strategies to put forward their impact  on execution behavior. 
%--[We will review in the related work section several other scheduling approaches.]


%----------------------- prediction tools --------------------------------------
Independently of  scheduling decisions,  accurate prediction  of the  runtime of
complex workloads is hampered by  multiple factors.  First \ac{iaas} operates in
a opaque fashion, the exact nature of the underlying platforms being unknown and
their hardware  subject to  evolution as  operators complete  their data-centers
over  the years  with new  servers and  equipment.  Secondly  cloud systems  are
multi-tenant by nature  which adds uncertainty due to contention  on network and
memory accesses, depending on how \ac{vm} are scheduled and the activity of your
\emph{neighbors}.   Even   when  \ac{iaas}  operators  attempt   to  mask  these
irregularities in computing  power and network access by  guaranteeing a minimum
performance, variability occurs  in presence of \emph{less-than-noisy-neighbors}
as it is not in the interest of the \ac{iaas} operators to limit power available
over the guaranteed minimums.  These factors  add to the already high difficulty
of  modeling   job  execution  times  on   a  network  of  computers   as  shown
in~\cite{Lastovetsky05}.

In this regard,  the prediction is highly dependent on  the underlying simulator
of the system and on the phenomena it  can capture. In this work, we rely on the
SimGrid~\cite{simgrid}  simulation toolkit,  enabling  to  build discrete  event
simulators of distributed systems such as Grids, Clouds, or HPC systems. SimGrid
has   been    chosen   for    its   well-studied   accuracy    against   reality
(e.g~\cite{StanisicTLVM15,VelhoSCL13}).    In   particular,  given   a   precise
description  of the  hardware platform,  its  network model  takes into  account
network contention in presence of multiple  communication flows and can model VM
boot times.

However, we may not be able to provide a fully accurate platform description, or
unable  to estimate  the network  cross-traffic, yielding  a distorsion  between
simulation and reality.  To deal with this problem, the  standard approach is to
consider job runtimes to  be stochastic.  Every job can be  modeled by a \ac{rv}
that models the whole spectrum of possible runtimes. These \ac{rv} are the basis
required for a stochastic simulation.  Such simulations output a random variable
of the  observed phenomenon (\emph{makespan}  or \emph{\ac{btu}}) which  in turn
can  be  used to  create  intervals  of  possible  results with  their  assorted
confidence.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic method to enrich the classical prediction
based  on the  discrete-event simulator  SimGrid,  and we  study the  conditions
needed for  this approach to be  relevant. This study  is carried out in  a real
setting,  described in  section~\ref{sec:work-context},  where the  applications
use-cases, the scheduler, and the  experimental observations are presented.  The
stochastic     framework     we     propose     is     then     presented     in
section~\ref{sec:enriched-sim}  and is  evaluated in  section~\ref{sec:eval}. We
finally conclude by  discussing the possible improvements and the  limits of the
approach.

\subsection{Simulation}

Because they allow for experiments on functionality without having to build a
dedicated platform, simulations are a cornerstone of the study of distributed
systems and clouds.  

Most cloud  simulator are based on  \ac{des}. In \aclp{des} the  simulation is a
series of events changing the state of  the simulated system.  Events can be the
start  (or  end)  of a  computation,  the  change  of  state of  a  machine,  or
disconnection of a network.  The simulator will jump from one event to the next,
updating the  times of  upcoming events to  reflect the change  of state  in the
simulation.   Such  \ac{des}  based  simulators  require  at  least  a  platform
specification  and  an  application  description.   The  platform  specification
describes both the physical nature of the cloud, e.g. machines and networks, and
the management rules, e.g.~\ac{vm} placement and availability.  Depending on the
simulator,  platform  specification  can  be  done  through  user  code,  as  in
CloudSim~\cite{cloudsim} for example, or  through platform description files, as
is  mostly  the case  in  SimGrid~\cite{simgrid}.   The application  description
consists in  a set of  computing and communication  tasks often described  as an
amount of computation of communication  to perform, which the simulator computes
the duration based on the platform  specification and its CPU or network models.
An  alternative  approach is  to  extrapolate  the  task durations  from  actual
execution traces observed in real executions.
%
% -------   no need to mention, not relevant to the paper ------------------------
% Although the application  is the active
% payload  of the  simulation it  is  not always  what  is being  observed by  the
% experimenter.   Application are  sometimes just  the backdrop  against which  we
% study specific cloud components. %e.g.~someone interested in testing new \ac{vm}
% placement algorithms will be simulating the same application multiple times
% while changing the platform specification.
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At  the core  of DES  is the  solver which  considers the  states of  the system
generated by the platform and previous events  to solve the timing of the future
events,  therefore allowing  the  simulation  to know  to  which  event to  jump
next. In  most cases simulators  have a  \emph{bottom-up} approach based  on the
modeling  of low  level components  (machines, networks,  storage devices),  and
large  scale  behaviours  emerge naturally  from  the  interactions  of  these
components. Working  on disjointed low level  components make it easier  to tune
the precision  of the model to  the wanted accuracy/speed trade-off.

However, in case the simulated system is subject to variability, it is difficult
to formally  establish the  validity of simulation  results. Indeed,  given some
definite inputs,  a DES  outputs a  single deterministic  result while  the real
system  will output  slightly different  results at  each repeated  execution on
those same inputs.  Hence, in practice  the simulation is informally regarded as
valid if  its results  are ``close'' to  one or some  of the  real observations.
Notice however  that in the  field of grid or  cloud computing, very  few papers
address the issue of the simulation validity.

\subsection{Stochastic Simulation and Monte-Carlo Method}

For  more   comprehensive  predictions  in  such   variables  environments,  the
simulation must  be \emph{stochastic}.  In stochastic simulations  inputs become
\acfp{rv} representing the  distribution of possible values  for the parameters.
The  result  of one  such  simulation  is  itself  an \ac{rv}  representing  the
distribution  of the  results.  This  approach has  been used  early to  compute
schedules for task graphs (\ac{dag}) with stochastic durations in the context of
PERT networks~\cite{Slyke63}.

%,  and applied in  the recent  years to
%heterogeneous distributed computing environments.  For example in the context of
%grids,  Tang  et al.~\cite{Tang11}  propose  a  modification of  the  well-known
%scheduling heuristic HEFT  to compute a schedule yielding  the shortest makespan
%given randomly variable task durations. 

Similarly in  our context,  an application's  jobs is modeled  as a  \ac{dag} in
which the vertices represent the jobs  comprising the application, and the edges
the dependencies between jobs.  Each vertex can then be assigned it's respective
\ac{rv}  representing   its  possible  runtimes.    The  result  is   a  \ac{rv}
representing  the possible  duration for  the execution  of the  whole \ac{dag},
called  \emph{makespan}. An  \ac{rv} is  defined by  its \ac{pdf}  and \ac{cdf},
where  the   \ac{cdf}  is  obtain   by  integrating  the  \ac{pdf}.    Works  on
heterogeneous  grids~\cite{Li97} and  PERT  networks~\cite{Ludwig01} show  that,
when  tasks runtimes  are  independent the  makespan of  successive  tasks is  a
convolution product  of the individual  tasks \acp{rv}, whereas the  makespan of
parallel tasks  joining is the  product of  the tasks respective  \ac{cdf}. This
mathematical approach is computationally intensive  and its core constraint, the
jobs \acp{rv} independence can not be guaranteed in most cases.

Moreover this \ac{dag} based approach implies fixed scheduling. In the context
of a cloud platform where additional resources can be provisioned at anytime
user are likely to call on dynamic schedulers that adapt the schedule on the fly
depending of the already executed jobs runtimes and the availability of
resources. In the context of a \ac{dag} representation this is akin to adding
and removing edges depending on the runtime of certain vertices. Edges do not
only represent the dependencies, the inherent constraint between the application
jobs, but also the scheduling, the effective constraint imposed on a job queued
after another.


Instead  of computing  the resulting  \ac{rv}, a  \ac{mcs} samples  the possible
results by testing  multiple \emph{realizations} in a  deterministic fashion.  A
realization is  obtained by drawing for  every job in the  application a runtime
that follows their job's respective \ac{rv}. Since within a realization each job
has now a  defined runtime, each realization can be  simulated using traditional
methods like \ac{des}.  Eventually, given enough realizations the distribution of
the simulations  results will  tend towards the  distribution of  the equivalent
stochastic  simulation.  Statistical  fitting  techniques can  then  be used  to
characterize this makespan \ac{rv}.

The development  of heterogeneous distributed computing  environments, grids and
now clouds,  has led  researchers to  use this  approach in  this field.  In the
context of grids,  where the number of resources is  fixed during one execution,
Tang et  al.~\cite{Tang11} propose a  modification of the  well-known scheduling
heuristic  HEFT to  compute  a  schedule yielding  the  shortest makespan  given
randomly  variable task  durations. Canon~\cite{Canon10}  have used  \ac{mcs} to
evaluate  the robustness  of \ac{dag}  schedules when  task durations  vary, and
similarly, Zheng et  al.~\cite{Zheng13} evaluate the impact  of this variability
on  makespan.  More  recently,  ElasticSim~\cite{Cai17} as  been  proposed as  a
simulator extending  Cloudsim to integrate resource  auto-scaling and stochastic
task  durations. Similarly  to our  work, Elasticsim  computes a  schedule whose
objective  is  to  minimize  rental  cost excepted  that  they  impose  deadline
constraints.  The  study evaluates  how  the  rental  cost and  makespan  change
depending  on the  variability of  task duration  and deadline,  for which  some
deviation  ranges  have  been  arbitrarily   chosen  to  bound  the  statistical
distribution used to draw random values. This  differs from our own work in that
we infer  the deviation ranges  from actual execution  traces and check  how the
makespan \ac{rv} covers actual observations, while their experiments compare the
stochastic schedules against a simulation based on generated workflows.



\section{Work Context}
\label{sec:work-context}

The  study conducted  in this  paper  is build  upon an  original comparison  of
experiments  run in  actual environments  and experimental  results obtained  by
simulation.   To strengthen  the validity  of the  comparison, the  experimental
conditions  for  the  real  setup  and  the  simulation  should  share  as  many
commonalities  as   possible~\cite{PucherGWK15}.   We  describe   hereafter  our
experimental setup.  It consists of two  test applications which are  run on one
side, on a real platform with our scheduler Schlouder and on the other side, are
simulated  with   our  simulator  SimSchlouder   based  on  SimGrid.    The  two
environments are sketched side by side on Figure~\ref{fig:rs}.

\subsection{Test Applications}\label{sc:setup}

To evaluate Schlouder performance we  carried out multiple executions of two
scientific applications. The  execution traces for those runs  were collected in
an archive. This  backlog of real executions is the  benchmark against which our
simulation performance will be evaluated. The applications used are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Montage\cite{montage2009},  the Montage Astronomical Image  Mosaic Engine,
  is designed to  splice astronomical images. The structure  of this application
  is a  fork-join type  workflow. This application  is extremely  data intensive
  with a \emph{commuication-to-computation} ratio superior to $90\%$.

\item OMSSA\cite{Geer2004}, the Open Mass-Spectrometry Search Algorithm, is used
  to analyze  mass-spectrometer results.  The application  is parallelized  as a
  bag-of-tasks, \textit{i.e.}  as a  number of  independent parallel  jobs. This
  application        is        computation        intensive        with        a
  \emph{communication-to-computation} ratio under $20\%$.
\end{itemize}

The executions of these applications each composed  of a set of jobs are driven
by the scheduling policy applied. We detail in the next two sections how these
executions are managed in the actual environment and in simulation.  

\subsection{Real Execution Setup}
In the recent years, we have developed  a client-side job broker for IaaS clouds
called Schlouder~\cite{Michon17}.  This broker is  able to submit on  the user's
batch jobs, be  it a set of  independent jobs or a workflow.   The broker's main
role is  to schedule the set  of jobs onto a  set of cloud resources,  which the
broker can scale up  or down depending on a \emph{strategy}  chosen by the user.
Technically, the broker  connects to the cloud management  system (for instance,
OpenStack) to  instruct how  the infrastructure should  be provisioned  and then
assigns the jobs to the resources using the Slurm job management system.

Applications are  submitted to Schlouder as  batch jobs. As in  almost all batch
scheduler  systems,  the job  description  provides  a runtime  estimate  called
\emph{user  estimate}. In  case of  a workflow,  the job  dependencies are  also
provide.   Schlouder uses  just-in-time scheduling  where jobs  are assigned  to
\acp{vm}  as   soon  as   all  their  dependencies   are  satisfied.    We  call
\emph{strategy}  the  heuristic  used  by Schlouder  to  make  provisioning  and
scheduling decisions.   A dozen strategies  and their variants are  available to
the user (details can be found in~\cite{GenaudG11}), of which we will use two in
this paper.  Strategies  provision \acp{vm} and schedule jobs based  on the user
estimates  of  the  runtime.   Notice  that  the  jobs'  real  runtimes,  called
\emph{effective  runtimes}, may  differ from  the estimates,  but this  does not
change the initial scheduling decision with  regards to which resources the jobs
are assigned.

The provisioning and scheduling strategies of Schlouder are bi-objective, namely
cost of renting the resources, and makespan of the execution.  In this paper, we
test the two following strategies which favor one of the objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item ASAP (or \textit{as soon as possible}): schedules the job immediately onto
  an idle VM, or immediately provisions a new  VM to start the job if no idle VM
  is available.  Hence this strategy tries to minimize the makespan of the batch
  job execution.

\item AFAP (or \textit{as full as  possible}): schedules each job in priority to
	an already available resource whenever the remaining time  before a new
	\ac{btu} begins is greater or equal to the job estimated runtime.
	By solving this bin-packing problem, this strategy tends to minimize the
	monetary cost of the batch execution.
\end{itemize}

The left  part of figure~\ref{fig:rs}  schematically presents the workflow  of a
real execution.  The  user sends to Schlouder  a list of jobs. For  each job the
user provides a runtime estimate (as in almost all batch scheduler systems), the
list  of  depedencies  and  the scheduling  strategy.   Schlouder  computes  the
scheduling and resource provisioning decisions  and communicates its requests to
the  cloud's  frontend,  denoted  Controller.   Once  the  \acp{vm}  are  booted
Schlouder  sends each  job to  its  assigned machine.   Schlouder tracks  jobs
progression, completing the schedule  as dependencies are resolved, provisioning
\acp{vm} as needed,  and shutting down unneeded \acp{vm} as  their billing cycle
close.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Simulated Execution Setup}
As a follow-up  to our work on Schlouder we  developed SimSchlouder, a simulator
mimicking  the  behaviour  of  Schlouder. Its  implements  the  same  scheduling
strategies  as  Schlouder  using  SimGrid  as its  core  simulation  engine.  In
practice, SimSchlouder  is included as  a plugin  into Schlouder and  allows the
user to request for  an estimate of the makespan and the  cost before choosing a
strategy for a real run.

As  shown on  the right  side of  Figure~\ref{fig:rs}, SimSchlouder  shares with
Schlouder a common  subset of inputs.  It  receives from the user a  set of jobs
with their  respective estimated  runtimes and dependencies,  and a  strategy to
use.  Whereas  Schlouder  operates  on a  real  cloud  controller,  SimSchlouder
provisions simulated \acp{vm} and jobs  through SimGrid's cloud interface called
SchIaaS. As  mentioned earlier,  the simulation requires  additional information
regarding the platform and processes simulated.
Most importantly, during a real execution  the \emph{effective runtime} is the
real observed runtime of a job, which might differ from the user estimate (used 
for scheduling purpose). For a better control of the simulation, SimSchlouder
can take observed effective runtimes as inputs. 

\begin{comment}
For the purpose of this paper, we classify the inputs required by SimSchlouder
in two categories. The first category is the operator inputs, which describe the
hardware platform and the cloud configuration. Internally, they are fed to the
SimGrid core and the \ac{iaas} simulation layer. The second category is the end
user inputs. They describe the workflow to simulate, the submission dates of
each job, the runtime prediction that would be provided to Schlouder.
Additionally for the purpose of the simulator, a user can choose to supply
effective runtimes to match, communication to simulate, or alternative boot
times for the \acp{vm}. These additional inputs are used to alter the sequence
of events simulated without interfering with parameters that would change the
provisioning or scheduling decisions made by SimSchlouder, e.g.\ having a job
overrun its runtime without changing the corresponding user prediction.

As mentioned above, the variability of real executions suggests that a simulation,
even if it was  perfectly accurate, would capture only one of the set
of possible real executions. We will show later that  the simulation is indeed
very   accurate  when   the  user   estimates  are   close  to   the  effective
runtimes. However,  to  provide the user  with a broader view  of how
their real executions could behave with job runtimes variability,  we should 
enrich the simulation framework with some form of stochastic prediction.

These two applications were executed using Schlouder on a private cloud.  We set
up a 96 core cloud based on four identical  dual $2.67GHz$ Intel Xeon X5650
servers with KVM-based virtualization  and an Openstack cloud-front (first
2012.1, and later 2014.2). This cluster was exclusively used by us and special
attention was taken to never overload the system.



Logs from the executions of these applications display variability in the jobs
individual runtimes, as well as in the application makespan, even when the
execution where scheduled on the same platforms using the same strategies. This
variability is inherent to executions in the cloud. SimSchlouder as shown
promising results when when simulating a given execution, but as a \ac{des} it
is ill-equipped to tackle cases wherein there is uncertainty as to the values of
job runtimes.

\section{Enriched Simulation Framework}
\label{sec:enriched-sim}

Trustworthiness of simulation is a major issue when simulating variable
environments such as clouds. If the result of the simulation is one of many
possible outcomes, it might not be a relevant enough information to the user. 
As such, providing a distribution of possible results is a better solution.

In this section we propose one such enriched simulation by instrumenting a
\ac{des}, SimSchlouder, as a stochastic simulator using the method of the
\acf{mcs}. This solution combines the relative simplicity of a \ac{des} with the
extensive results provides by stochastic simulations. This approach guarantees
that our simulation respects the scheduling and provisioning decisions observed
in real life, as the \ac{des} can easily be programmed to reproduce such
decisions, whereas integrating the implication of such decisions in the already
complex computation of the numerical results of a stochastic would be
impossible.

In this section we will first discuss the particularities of the Monte Carlo
Simulation. Then we present the real run we use as a reference point for this
experiment. At last we will explore the steps taken to model the
input \acp{rv} representing the jobs runtimes.

\subsection{Simulation Process}
%\paragraph{Method} 
As  depicted   on  Figure~\ref{fig:mc-process},  we  consider   an  application
consisting of  $n$ jobs, independent  or organized as  a workflow. For  each job
$i  \in\,[1;n]$, we provide  a runtime distribution $T_i$ following the method
described in section~\ref{sec:im}.

\end{figure}

One MCS-iteration then consists in 
\begin{itemize}
\item making one realization of the runtime  for each job $i$, that is randomly
  drawing a runtime value from the associated $T_i$ to obtain a runtime $t_i$,
\item and once runtimes have been drawn for all jobs, proceed to a simulation
  of the execution with these runtime values to obtain a makespan $m$.
\end{itemize}
The whole \ac{mcs} process  consists in repeating this iteration a  large number
of times (500 times  on the  figure). From the  set of makespans  $m_k$ obtained
at each step, we compute  a statistical distribution of the makespan  as a final
\ac{rv} noted $M$.

Figure~\ref{fig:mc-process}  schematically  presents a  \ac{mcs}  of  a $n$  job
workflow.   The  input  of  the  simulation  is  a  set  of  $n$  \acp{rv}  each
corresponding to a given job, denoted by  indices. A realization is a set of $n$
runtimes that are drawn according to each jobs respective \ac{rv}.  Each of this
realization is  simulated independently,  providing a makespan  sample.  Finally
the sample are  aggregated in the final distribution.  This  approach enables to
sidestep intense numerical resolution  by simply repeating simpler deterministic
simulations and  have realizations scheduled as  they would based on  their jobs
runtimes by having dynamical scheduling integrated inside the simulator.


In this paper the full process taking as input runtimes distribution for
every jobs and providing as results the makespan distribution is referred to as a
\acf{mcs}. The multiple executions of SimSchlouder performed by the \ac{mcs} are
referred to as \emph{simulations}.

Because of the \emph{pay-as-you-go} nature of the cloud we extend our simulation
to two output variables: we will not only observe the makespan computed at any
step but also the cost for each execution in number of \ac{btu}, that is the
number of VM-hours started during this simulation.

The simulation engine SimSchlouder  takes as input the user estimates
$T_1, \ldots , T_n$ for the job runtimes, schedules the jobs and finally outputs
the makespan $M$ of the whole batch.  The user estimates might be inaccurate
and  we describe  hereafter  a method  to characterize  the  impact of  repeated
imprecisions (on each  job runtime) on the final makespan.   We have developed a
\ac{mcs} tool to  compute a confidence interval around the  makespan produced by
simulation.  Let us sketch the overall process (see Fig~\ref{fig:mc-process}):
\begin{itemize} 
\item from  the set of  specified runtimes  $\{T_i\}$, the system  generates $s$
  sets  of perturbed  runtimes $\{T_i^1\},  \ldots, \{T_i^s\}$.   Each perturbed
  runtime  is a  random  value  uniformly drawn  around  $T_i$  (to be explained
  below). We call \emph{realization} each such random draw of a set of perturbed
  runtimes.
\item a simulation  is run for each realization, producing  a makespan $M^i$ and
  BTU count sample for each,
\item a  normal distribution ${\cal  N}(\mu,\sigma)$ is fitted on  the different
  makespan values.
\end{itemize}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fitting is done to a normal distribution because, in essence the makespan is the
sum  of the  runtimes of  the jobs  on the  critical path  of the  schedule.  To
measure the impact  of the runtime perturbation on the  makespan, we compute the
range $[\mu-2\sigma;\mu+2\sigma]$ (that is  a 95\% confidence interval) relative
to  the mean  $\mu$.

\subsection{Real Observations}


During the development of Schlouder, the cloud broker described in
Section~\ref{sec:work-context}, we performed multiple executions of the
application of OMSSA and Montage. These executions were performed on a 96 core
Openstack cloud system set up on 4 identical dual $2.67GHz$ Intel Xeon X5650
servers. We used the KVM hypervisor and Openstack version 2012.1 and 2014.4.

Schlouder  execution  traces obtained  from  these  experiments contain  several
useful metrics  including, but  not limited  to, the  \ac{vm} start  dates, boot
time, shutdown  times, and assigned  tasks, as well as  the task start  date and
effective  runtimes. We  previously used  these traces  as a  means to  test the
validity of Simschlouder.   These metrics will be used to  generate our \ac{mcs}
input \acp{rv} using the method we will describe in Section~\ref{sec:im}, and we
will compare  the makespan  and \ac{btu}  distributions of  the \ac{mcs}  to the
distribution observed in the corresponding traces.

For this purpose we grouped traces  from comparable runs.  A group contains runs
of a  same application  using the same  strategy on a  same cloud  platform. The
number of observations in  those groups is uneven due to  the changing nature of
the    experimental   conditions    in   which    the   runs    were   executed.
Table~\ref{tab:nbruns}  presents  an  overview   of  the  selected  sets,  while
Figure~\ref{fig:realbrs} presents the distribution of resulting makespans and
\ac{btu} counts observed depending on application and scheduling strategy. These
figures show that even in our platform we observe significant makespan
variability.

\subsection{Input Modeling}\label{sec:im}

The volatile nature of cloud platform means that effective runtimes are always
variable. Using a \ac{mcs} we can account for this variability and provide the
user with a range of possible makespans. In this section we propose a simple
method to represent the potential variability by creating a small range around
the estimated runtimes. We test this method against our backlog of real runs.
The key finding detailed hereafter is that this simple method can be precise
enough for the \ac{mcs} to predict 90\% for real runs.

This model for the runtimes \acp{rv} uses a job's estimated runtime and a unique
perturbation level used on every job. The perturbation level, expressed as a
percentage an denoted as P, is used to build a range around the estimated
runtime in which the simulations effective runtimes will be drawn. 

We test the validity of this method by applying it on our experiment traces, and
check the \ac{mcs} results against the real observed makespans. We assume a good
guess for an estimated runtime is the average of all observed runtimes for a
given job. As such $t_j$, the drawn time of job $j$, can be written as~:

\begin{equation}
	t_j = \bar{R_j} \cdot (1 + p)
	\label{eq:t}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\bar{R_j} = \underset{n}{\textrm{mean}}\{r_j^n\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	p = \mathcal{U}(-P,+P)
	\label{eq:r}
\end{equation}

where $r_j^n$ is the $n$th runtime observation for job $j$, $\bar{R_j}$ is the
average of all observed runtimes for job $j$, and $\mathcal{U}$ an uniform distribution.

To obtain the global perturbation level, which limits the worst deviations from
the estimated runtimes, we average the worst observed deviation for every job in
the application, formally expressed as :

\begin{equation}
P = \textrm{mean}(\delta{}_j)
\label{eq:P}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta{}_j =
\max_n\left(\frac{r_j^n-\bar{R_j}}{\bar{R_j}}\right)
\label{eq:d}
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
Core  to the  \acl{mcs} is  the accuracy  of our  job runtimes  inputs. Given  a
precise simulator and enough samples, the \ac{mcs} will return a precise result,
but this  result corresponds to  the reality described  by the inputs.  In other
words, for the result to be a good  predictor of the reality, the inputs must be
a good descriptor of reality.

Hence, we seek  to determine which is  the range of acceptable  input values for
the  \ac{mcs} to  produce accurate  enough predictions  (in terms  of confidence
interval),  and we call this  search \emph{input  modeling}.  Answering  this
question will tell us the  acceptable margin of error in the  user estimate for the
method to be relevant.
An ideal  model would present  an individual distribution  for every job  in the
workflow, and such a distribution would require a deep understanding of the jobs
computation, communication, and  of the underlying platform.  In  real life such
modeling  is not  practical  as the  underlying platform  is  usually not
precisely  known, and  the user might not be very familiar with the application.
For this reason, despite having a comprehensive archive ourselves, we choose to 
use a more generic model.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:MCS}, for the purpose of our \ac{mcs} we
consider job runtimes as a base runtime on which a perturbation is applied. The
extent of this perturbation is called the \emph{perturbation level} and is
denoted $P$. Though the base is determined job per job, the perturbation level
is set simulation wide. We set the effective runtime of a job $i$ within the
$n$\textit{-th} simulation of an \ac{mcs} to: 
\begin{equation}
	T_i^n = T_i * (1+r_i^n)
\end{equation}
with $r_i^n$ the perturbation value drawn between $[-P;+P]$.

As we  will see  in Section~\ref{sec:sa},  the parameters $T_i$  and $P$  have a
great influence on the \ac{mcs} results.  Our findings are that the best results
are obtained by  taking as $T_i$ the average effective  runtime observed for job
$i$ for a given  strategy. This corresponds to the guess of a knowledgeable user.
Regarding  the simulation  wide perturbation level  $P$, we found  that the best
setting  is the average  of the worst relative deviations for all jobs in the
workload:
\begin{equation}
P = \underset{i}{\textrm{mean}}(\delta{}_i)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\delta{}_i =
\max_n\left(\frac{R_i^n-\textrm{mean}(R_i)}{\textrm{mean}(R_i)}\right)
\end{equation}
with $R_i^n$ the observed effective runtime for job $i$ during execution $n$. 
\end{comment}

For OMSSA, the perturbation level given by this method is roughly 10\% for both
strategies. For Montage  our calculated perturbation level is  20\% when looking
at ASAP  executions and  5\% when  looking at AFAP  executions. We  believe this
difference can be partially  explained by the low number of  montage runs in the
archive. As such we make the hypothesis that the runtime variability comes
mostly from the platform and will also try simulations of Montage with a 10\%
perturbation level.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We ran 500 iterations \acp{mcs} for all strategy-application combinations using
the job models described in the previous section. The resulting distribution are
shown in figure~\ref{fig:fit}. The makespan density graphs show the simulation
result distribution as filled curves and the real observed executions, taken
from fig.~\ref{fig:realbrs}, as simple curves. On the \ac{btu} count graphs real
observed \ac{btu} counts appear in left columns and simulation result
distribution are in the right. Each graph shows for both strategy the
distribution of a specific metric for a given application.

When looking at the resulting OMSSA distributions, presented in the first two
graphs, the distribution of simulated makespan has good coverage, that is the
simulated makespan range covers fairly well the range of observed makespans. But
simulated distribution does not appear to show the skewness observed in real
runs. Simulated makespan distributions appear mostly symmetrical whereas the
observed makespan distributions are not. This is a consequence of our input
model, in which job distributions are also symmetrical when this was not the
case in real executions. Looking at the OMSSA BTU count distributions offers
similar results.  In the AFAP case both real observation and simulated results
indicate between 33 and 36 BTU are required for an execution, but the simulated
distribution does not share the real observation skewness towards lower values.
The ASAP strategy shows a very stable BTU count which is perfectly matched by
the simulation.

To provide a more quantitative approach when discussing makespan distribution we
decide to fit simulated distribution to a normal distribution. This allows us to
build confidence intervals that can be checked against real observations.  Since
the makespan is in essence the sum of the runtimes of the jobs in that
executions critical path, and job are all distributed using the uniform
distribution which has a finite variance, we consider the Central Limit Theorem
to be applicable. Hence our choice to fit the simulated distribution to a normal
distribution. The fitting process gives us an average makespan $\mu{}$, and a
standard deviation $\sigma{}$. This allows to build \acp{ci}. The 95\% \ac{ci}
of the normal distribution is defined as $[\mu{}-2\sigma{},\mu{}+2\sigma{}]$ and
the 99\% \ac{ci} is $[\mu{}-3\sigma{},\mu{}+3\sigma{}]$.

\end{figure*}

Table~\ref{tab:fit} presents the capture rate obtained by each interval computed
after normal fitting. The capture rate expresses the number of observed real
makespans that fall withing a given \ac{ci} relative to the total number of real
observations. Since improving the capture rate is always possible at the cost of
enlarging the \ac{ci} and therefore diminishing it's relevance, we provide for
each interval its size relative to the average makespan. For example the first
line of table~\ref{tab:fit} presents the results for OMSSA using the ASAP
strategy, this this case the 95\% \ac{ci} spanned 419s, from 12797s to 13216s,
for an average makespan of 13006s. Therefore the relative size is given as 3\%.

Still, on OMSSA we can see that our normal fitting in not perfect as our \acp{ci}
appears of by 5\% with the 95\% \ac{ci} capturing only 90\% real observations.
This result can be greatly improved upon using a 99\% \ac{ci} which managed to
capture 98\% of real observations.

Simulating Montage with the computed perturbation levels, as discussed in
section~\ref{sec:im} 20\% when using ASAP and 5\% with AFAP, we obtained 100\%
capture rate. The results displayed in the figure~\ref{fig:fit} and
table~\ref{tab:fit} are for simulations done with the 10\% perturbation level.   
Here again the graph shows great coverage. Distribution can not be significantly
tested due to the lackluster number of real runs. The quantitative approach
confirms our observation. The low number of evaluation limits our ability to
have a good look at distribution, but the platform on which these experiments
were run does not exist at this time preventing us from obtaining new real
executions \textbf{FIXME: bien réfléchir si on ne se tire pas une balle dans le
  pied}.
 We kept this limited Montage run as to check that the results
obtained with OMSSA would not completely fail with an application with strong
dependencies. These results give confidence that our method is extendable to
workflow type applications.  

Improving the \ac{mcs} results would require better inputs models and a better
characterization of the results less reliant on the normal distribution which
cannot reflect skewness. Although such improvements would be possible in this
experiment, this is only the case because we work with the benefit of hindsight.
We believe that our model is representative of what a knowledgeable user could
create upfront. In these condition users should expect to be able to obtain
\ac{ci} for 90\% of the runs. Although not perfect the \ac{mcs} offers plenty of
opportunities other than runtime and cost predictions.

\begin{comment}
We evaluate the  validity of our simulation based on  two different factors, the
\emph{makespan capture  rate} and  the \emph{BTU capture rate}.   The makespan
capture rate is the percentage of  real makespans which fall into the confidence
interval generated by fitting the  makespans of our individual simulations using
a Normal distribution, as  discussed in Section~\ref{sec:MCS}.  Unless otherwise
specified we  use a standard 95\%  confidence interval of width  $4\sigma$.  BTU
capture rate is the ratio of BTU counts found in the simulation to the BTU
counts observed  during our  real runs.  Figure~\ref{fig:fit} shows  results for
\acp{mcs} using  the input  model presented  in the previous  section at  a 10\%
perturbation level.

Table~\ref{tab:fit}  summarizes the  results obtained  with a  10\% perturbation
level. Along with the makespan capture rates included in parenthesis is the size
of the confidence interval relative to  the average makespan.  With our model we
are able to  capture 90\% of real executions  in ASAP and 92\% of  real AFAP run
for OMSSA\@.  These intervals  span 7  and 10  minutes respectively  whereas the
results in our archive  spread over 10 and 11 minutes.   Using a 99\% confidence
interval results in  better capture rates of  100\% for AFAP and  98\% for ASAP,
but also  in wider intervals  of 15 minutes.  Such  an interval increase  may be
seen as having little impact, like in  our OMSSA use-case exhibiting 3 to 4 hour
runs. Probably this choice of the confidence interval is best left to the user.

For cost prediction our enriched  simulation finds exactly the same possibilities
as experienced in reality, though in  the case of AFAP, repartition favors higher
BTU counts, slightly more than observed in our backlog.

Working on Montage when using \acp{mcs} with the perturbation level of its
respective strategy, as seen in Section~\ref{sec:im}, the capture rate is 100\%
across all strategies. This capture rate is maintained when using the 10\%
perturbation obtained using the OMSSA archive. In this cases the intervals span
from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes for AFAP and ASAP respectively on workflow lasting from
47 and 25 minutes respectively. Because Montage runs in less than 1 hour BTU 
counts are naturally stable, which is perfectly assessed by our simulations.

The results shown in  this section show that provided a  good description of job
runtimes our simulator will provide  good predictions of the possible executions
of these runs. However, though we strived to keep our input modeling as simple
as possible, the  benefits of hindsight provided by the  archive means that only
the users most knowledgeable about their  workload and the targeted platform can
hope to achieve such predictions.  In Section~\ref{sec:lim}, we will discuss the
limits we experienced with this approach. In the next section we show by comparing
different \acp{mcs}  that we are able  to study the behavior  of the strategies
when confronted with different applications and perturbation levels.
\end{comment}



\section{Discussion}

Outside of the realm of reproduction or predictions, we believe that \ac{mcs}
can have other more research oriented applications. In this section we will
exemplify one such application. Then we will discuss limitation we have
encountered in our work with \ac{mcs}.

\subsection{Strategy analysis}\label{sec:sa}
During our work on defining the perturbation level to be applied to our average
runtimes. We experimented with arbitrarily defined perturbation levels. This
raises interesting usage of \acp{mcs}.

Figure~\ref{fig:int} presents the resulting \acp{ci} for simulations with a 10\%
and 40\% perturbation levels. On the makespan interval graphs (first and third
subfigures) the boxes represent the span of the capture interval. For reference
the inside bar representing a single simulation using the average runtimes
without any random element has been added.  Comparing the interval of perturbed
simulation to this unperturbed simulation allows us to better see the effect of
perturbation on the strategy. In the middle row of these subfigures, are
presented for reference the interval spanning the minimum and maximum observed
real makespans over all runs. These \ac{ci} subfigures only present ASAP
strategy whereas the BTU distribution subfigures  present both strategies.

The first subfigure presenting the \acp{ci} for OMSSA using the ASAP strategy at
40\% and 10\% perturbation levels. With the increase of the perturbation level
the intervals naturally get wider, but the average makespan, by definition the
center of the capture interval, also gets higher. On OMSSA this happens to the
extent that the lower bound of our interval at 40\% is higher than the lower
bound at 10\%. This impacts the capture rate of the simulation from 90\%
(table~\ref{tab:fit}) to 83\% all the while bringing the width of the interval
relative to the average value to 10\% (almost 24 minutes) up from 3\% (7 minutes).

This result is two-fold. First this demonstrates that the perturbation level can
not be used as a trade-off variable to augment capture rate at the expense of
\ac{ci} compacity. The lower capture rate at a 40\% perturbation level is a
strong indication that our real platform exhibits a variability closer to
10\% than to 40\%. People for whom higher capture rates are more important than
interval compacity should use statistical methods to build higher rate \acp{ci},
like in our case the 99\% normal distribution \ac{ci}.

Secondly this result shows how an \ac{mcs} can be used to exhibit strategy
behaviours. This upwards shift of the \ac{ci} shows that ASAP, a strategy
geared towards reducing the makespan regardless of cost, is not as effective
when scheduling bag-of-tasks in environments where job runtimes might vary
widely. By testing Montage in the same way (third subfigure) we see that when
scheduling workflows this behaviour does not happen to the same extent. The
average makespan still rises, but not as fast as the interval grows, the \ac{ci}
at a 40\% perturbation level is a superset of the one at a 10\% perturbation
level. In the case of ASAP this behaviour could probably have been predicted by
closely examining the code of the scheduling strategy. Both the makespans upward
slide and its relative resilience when scheduling workflow instead of
bags-of-tasks are trivial consequences of its code. But this analysis does not
require foreknowledge of the scheduling strategies internals, other obviously
than having it coded in the simulation, and therefore \ac{mcs} can be used to
study or intuit the behaviour of complex scheduling strategies and test their
consistence in various environment 


\subsection{Advantages and limitations of the enriched simulation}\label{sec:lim}

In this section we discuss parameters that one might want to account for when
using an \ac{mcs}. At these points in time we have not yet studied how they
influence the \ac{mcs} or its result but are looking on to evaluate them in
future works.

In this article the only variable parameter is jobs runtimes. As such these
runtimes coalesce all sources of variability, change in available CPU time,
network or memory contention and application inherent variability. We did so
because this approach is closer to a cloud broker user scenario and  the
execution traces we had did not allow for us to separate in convincing way these
different variability. In circumstance where one is able to measure variability
on CPU power or network speed it is possible to add those variable as input of
the \ac{mcs}. In this case a realization would draw not only each jobs size (in
op/flop) but also a platform with different CPU powers and network speed.
\acp{mcs} allow to fuse these different variability effortlessly, but it will
require more iterations. 

In this paper all the \ac{mcs} presented used 500 iterations, that is 500
different runs of our \ac{des}. We determined that this was enough in the
context of our simulation as additional simulation did not change the results
and only marginally increased the confidence of the fitting process. The number
of simulation necessary in an \ac{mcs} depends on the number of input variables
and the distribution of these variables. \aclp{mcs} work by sampling the possible
scenarios to get a distribution of possible. As such the more scenarios are
possible the more samples are required. In our cases not only the number of jobs
was low, 223 jobs for OMSSA and 184 jobs for Montage, but with a 10\%
perturbation level the input variable distribution was compact. At a 40\%
perturbation level there was a significant drop in the confidence of our fitting
method. We are currently are method to determine the number of necessary
iterations.

\section{Conclusion}
Predicting  the execution  behavior  of complex  workloads in  the  cloud is  an
important challenge. While a number of research works have proposed model-driven
simulators, much remains to be done for their adoption in production-grade cloud
settings. As  advocated by Puchert  et al.~\cite{PucherGWK15}, the trust  we can
put in  the prediction  demands certainty  and precision  that only  comes from
validating simulation against empirical observation.

This paper contributes to this effort in two ways. First, we propose a
\acl{mcs} extension to a discrete event simulator based on SimGrid. This
extension provides stochastic predictions which are more informative than single
values of cost and makespan. Second, we apply our method in a real setting,
on both a bag-of-tasks and a workflow application for which we have collected
execution traces. Our study puts forward the conditions for the applicability of
the method, especially regarding the impact of the initial user estimates of the
jobs' runtimes, which are central to any scheduling process. The first
perspective of this work is to apply the method to production clouds. In this
paper we managed to aggregate all the different sources of uncertainty into a
perturbation on the job's runtime. We are interested in checking whether this is
still possible in highly variable environments. Our second perspective, now that
we are confident in our ability to simulate application executions, is to move
away from the applications in our archive and use our enriched simulation to
study the interactions between scheduling and workflow. More specifically, we
are interested in how the structure of a workflow affects a scheduling's
robustness, that is, its ability to satisfy predetermined constraints in terms of
deadline or cost.
