@page howto_scheduler_intro How to study schedulers

This tutorial presents how to study one or several VM to PM schedulers. 
Those schedulers decide which physical machine (PM) should host the vitual machines (VM). The objective can be very different: balance the resources usage, keep room for future VMs, or lower the energy consumption. 

Studying schedulers is mandatory, for instance, when:
- the designer of a new scheduler wants to compare it against other ones;
- an administrator has to choose a scheduler for a cloud platform;
- an administrator has to tune one scheduler for a cloud platform...

@section howto_scheduler_build Building the simulator

The first step is to build the simulator to support your study.

@subsection howto_scheduler_build_impl Implementing the scheduler

Implementing a scheduler is done by extending the <a href="./javadoc/schiaas/org/simgrid/schiaas/engine/compute/ComputeScheduler.html">ComputeScheduler</a> abstract class. 

Provided in SCHIaaS, there are two basic schedulers, that can be used as examples.

- <a href="./javadoc/schiaas/org/simgrid/schiaas/engine/compute/scheduler/simplescheduler/SimpleScheduler.html">SimpleScheduler</a>, a weight-based scheduler supporting two types of objectives: *balancer* to balance the VM among the PM (default openstack behavior); *consolidator* to concentrate the VM among as few PM as possible.

- <a href="./javadoc/schiaas/org/simgrid/schiaas/engine/compute/scheduler/simplescheduler/SimpleReconfigurator.html">SimpleReconfigurator</a>, does the same as *SimpleScheduler*, but reconfigures the placement along the time by migrating one VM to a better place, every *delay* seconds.

Once the schedulers to be studied are implemented, the simulator needs a cloud application to load the simulated platform (i.e. start and stop VM, and change their loads).


@subsection howto_scheduler_build_app Simulating the loads

Any SCHIaaS application can be used to induced loads into the simulation, for instance the basic *MasterSlave* example. If the study concerns scientific computing, looking at \ref simschlouder might be a good idea.

However, the most efficient application might be *loadinjector.SimpleInjection* (that can be found in the examples directory).

Its only purpose is to run injectors, as decribed by the <a href="./javadoc/schiaas/org/simgrid/schiaas/loadinjector/AbstractInjector.html">AbstractInjector</a> abstract class. Injectors are processes that start and stop VM, and change their load along time. 

Provided with SCHIaaS is the *SinInjector*, which injects sinusoïd loads, according to min and max values, and period of the sinusoïd, for both amount of VM and VM CPU load. It is a good example for designing more complex injectors.

The *loadinjector.SimpleInjection* simulator needs four arguments: *platform.xml deploy.xml cloud.xml injector.xml*, that is the same as any SCHIaaS simulator, plus the configuration of the the injector, which looks like this:
@code
<?xml version='1.0'?>
 <!DOCTYPE injectors>
 <injectors>
  <injector id="myInjectorSlow"
   class="org.simgrid.schiaas.loadinjector.injectors.SinInjector"
   cloud="myCloud">
	 	
   <config 
    start_date="0"
    duration="2000"
    period="3"
    instance_period="1000"
    instance_min="10"
    instance_max="192"
    load_period="100"
    load_min="90"
    load_max="100"
    image_id="myImage"
    instance_type_id="small-dp30"
   />
  </injector> 
 </injectors>
@endcode

Please look at <a href="./javadoc/schiaas/index.html">SinInjector javadoc</a> for details.


@subsection howto_scheduler_build_jar Making the simulator

At this stage, you should have a simulator, able to use your scheduler as well as any other scheduler, and an application that loads the cloud.

It is recommended to build jar files of your simulator, to ease its executions in the next steps.


@section howto_scheduler_running Running the simulations

In the following, we will use *loadinjector.SimpleInjection* and compare 5 schedulers:
- *SimpleScheduler* whith type *balancer*;
- *SimpleScheduler* whith type *consolidator*;
- *SimpleReconfigurator* whith type *consolidator* and delay *0*;
- *SimpleReconfigurator* whith type *consolidator* and delay *10*;
- *SimpleReconfigurator* whith type *consolidator* and delay *100*;

NB: The last three schedulers show how this can be used to tune a scheduler. The *delay* is the time (in s.) between two VM migrations.

Please make sure to set the *CLASSPATH* var in order to make the simulator runnable by:
@code
$ java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud.xml injector.xml
@endcode 

The study will use **the lab** provided with SCHIaaS (see \ref lab_lab).


@subsection howto_scheduler_running_setup Setting up the lab

@subsubsection howto_scheduler_running_setup_sim Configuration of the simulator

To setup the lab:
- create a directory in ./lab/setup, for instance ./lab/setup/cmp-scheduler;
- put the files needed by the simulator in this directory, that is 
  - platform.xml deploy.xml injector.xml, that are common to all simulations;
  - different versions of cloud.xml, to specify the studied schedulers:
    - cloud-balancer.xml
@code
<scheduler name="org.simgrid.schiaas.engine.compute.scheduler.simplescheduler.SimpleScheduler"
		type="balancer"/>
@endcode    
    - cloud-balancer.xml
@code
<scheduler name="org.simgrid.schiaas.engine.compute.scheduler.simplescheduler.SimpleScheduler"
		type="consolidator"/>
@endcode    
    - cloud-reconsolidator0.xml
@code
<scheduler name="org.simgrid.schiaas.engine.compute.scheduler.simplescheduler.SimpleReconfigurator"
		type="consolidator"
		controller="controller"
		delay="0"/>
@endcode    
    - cloud-reconsolidator10.xml
@code
<scheduler name="org.simgrid.schiaas.engine.compute.scheduler.simplescheduler.SimpleReconfigurator"
		type="consolidator"
		controller="controller"
		delay="10"/>
@endcode    
    - cloud-reconsolidator0.xml
@code
<scheduler name="org.simgrid.schiaas.engine.compute.scheduler.simplescheduler.SimpleReconfigurator"
		type="consolidator"
		controller="controller"
		delay="100"/>
@endcode    

NB: *controller* indicates which host to use to run the scheduler processes.



@subsubsection howto_scheduler_running_setup_cfg Configuration of the lab

The following file *cmp-schedulers.cfg* describes the simulations to run:
@code
SETUP_DIR ./setup/cmp-scheduler

SIM_ARG 1 loadinjector.SimpleInjection
SIM_ARG 2 platform.xml 
SIM_ARG 3 deploy.xml
SIM_ARG 4:balancer cloud-balancer.xml
SIM_ARG 4:consolidator cloud-consolidator.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator0 cloud-reconsolidator0.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator10 cloud-reconsolidator10.xml 
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator100 cloud-reconsolidator100.xml
SIM_ARG 5:slow injector-slow.xml 
@endcode
where:
- *SETUP_DIR* is the location of the files;
- *SIM_ARG x[:id] arg* indicates the argument of the simulation 
  - *x*: the id of the argument (must be grouped);
  - *id*: the id of the simulations using this argument;
  - *arg*: the argument.

Afterward, the simulations can be ran using:
@code
./lab -p 2 setup/cmp-scheduler/cmp-scheduler.cfg 
@endcode

This will execute:
@code
java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud-balancer.xml injector.xml
java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud-consolidator.xml injector.xml
java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud-reconsolidator0.xml injector.xml
java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud-reconsolidator10.xml injector.xml
java loadinjector.SimpleInjection platform.xml deploy.xml cloud-reconsolidator100.xml injector.xml
@endcode

NB: -p 2 makes 2 simulations to run in parallel.

This will then create subdirectories in the directory *simulations*, according to the ids given in the configuration file:

@code
$ ls -R simulations/

simulations.args      xp_consolidator_slow     xp_reconsolidator100_slow
xp_balancer_slow  xp_reconsolidator0_slow  xp_reconsolidator10_slow

../simulations/xp_balancer_slow:
schiaas.trace  simgrid.out

../simulations/xp_consolidator_slow:
schiaas.trace  simgrid.out

../simulations/xp_reconsolidator0_slow:
schiaas.trace  simgrid.out

../simulations/xp_reconsolidator100_slow:
schiaas.trace  simgrid.out

../simulations/xp_reconsolidator10_slow:
schiaas.trace  simgrid.out
@endcode




@section howto_scheduler_observing Observing the simulations

This section shows how the results of these simulations can be observed.

@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_series Identifying the observations

First of all, let's identify what can be observed, using ./bin/trace-util.py.

@code
$ ./trace-util.py simulations/xp_balancer_slow/schiaas.trace --info -d

          "controller": "property: Host used as controller for the entity",
          "compute_host": {
            ".*": {
              "cores": "property: Number of cores of the entity",
              "ram_size": "property: SimGrid's VM property",
              "diskSize": "property: Size of disk in MB",
              "used_cores": "event: Number of cores in use"
            }
          },
          "instances": {
            ".*": {
              "image": "property: VM image",
              "instance_type": "property: Type of instance",
              "command": "event: User command issued regarding the entity",
              "load": "event: CPU load",
              "schedule": "event: Host to which the instance is scheduled"
            }
          },
          "scheduler": {
            "name": "property:  Name of the entity",
            "controller": "property: Host used as controller for the entity",
            "type": "property:  Type of the entity"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "injector": {
      "myInjectorSlow": {
        "injector": "property:  Class of injector",
        "random_seed": "property:  Seed used to randomize the entity",
        "instances_count": "event:  Number of instances",
        "instances_load": "event:  CPU load"
      }
    },
    "vm": {
      ".*": {
        "n_cores": "property: SimGrid's VM property",
        "ram_size": "property: SimGrid's VM property",
        "net_cap": "property: SimGrid's VM property",
        "disk_path": "property: SimGrid's VM property",
        "disk_size": "property: SimGrid's VM property",

        "state": "event: State of the entity"
      }
    }
  }
}
@endcode


@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_loads Observing the injection

Then, let's observe the injection: these are the events *instances_count* in the injector section. 

The format is always [entity] [date] [value].

One can simply use grep:
@code
$ cat simulations/xp_balancer_slow/schiaas.trace | grep instances_count 

root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	0.0	101
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	10.0	102
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	20.0	103
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	30.0	104
...
@endcode

Or trace-util.py:
@code
$ ./bin/trace-util.py simulations/xp_balancer_slow/schiaas.trace --event instances_count
entity	date	value

root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	0.0	101
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	10.0	102
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	20.0	103
root:injector:myInjector:instances_count	30.0	104
...
@endcode

Such observations can be automatized by adding the following line to *cmp-scheduler.cfg*:
@code
R_SCRIPT template.R
TU_ARG --event instances_count 
@endcode
and a file template.R in the setup directory, with this content:
@code
source('reads.R')
pdf('data.pdf')
source('plots.R')
dev.off()
@endcode

Afterward, running the lab
@code
./lab -k setup/cmp-scheduler/cmp-scheduler.cfg 
@endcode
NB: -k allows to keep the results of previous simulations.

This will create files in the directory ./data: [simulation_id].instances_count.dat and plot their content using R into ./data/data.pdf:

\image html xp_balancer_slow.instances_count.png

To check the effect of this injection on the cloud, one can count the virtual machines that are in the running state:
@code
TU_ARG --count_if vm.*state eq running
@endcode

\image html xp_balancer_slow.vm__state_eq_running.png


Alternatively, one can plot the states of the vms:
@code
TU_ARG --grep vm.*state
@endcode

\image html xp_balancer_slow.vm__state.png

Please note the black area at the left of the figure: those are the names of the vms. They are not correctly plotted because of the large number of vms. 
Be aware that the objective of the lab is not to produce ready-to-publish plots, but only to provide efficient tools to quickly mine simulations data.

@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_usage Observing the usage of hosts

To observe the behavior of the scheduler, let's look at the number of cores used by VMs on each host:
@code
TU_ARG --event used_cores
@endcode

With balancer, the vm are well spread among the hosts:
\image html xp_balancer_slow.used_cores.png

With consolidator, there is some heterogenity in the number of used cores at a given date, especialy when the load change:
\image html xp_consolidator_slow.used_cores.png

With reconsolidator, this heterogenity is maximized all along the simulation:
\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slow.used_cores.png


@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_green Observing how many hosts are idle

For green purpose, one may want to shut hosts down. Thus, many schedulers aim at minimizing the number of busy physical hosts.

Let's count the number of busy hosts, that is hosts not having 0 used cores:

@code
TU_ARG --count_if used_cores ne 0
@endcode

\image html xp_balancer_slow.used_cores_ne_0.png
\image html xp_consolidator_slow.used_cores_ne_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slow.used_cores_ne_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator10_slow.used_cores_ne_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator100_slow.used_cores_ne_0.png

Or alternatively, the number of idle hosts, those that could be shut down:
@code
TU_ARG --count_if used_cores eq 0
@endcode

\image html xp_balancer_slow.used_cores_eq_0.png
\image html xp_consolidator_slow.used_cores_eq_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slow.used_cores_eq_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator10_slow.used_cores_eq_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator100_slow.used_cores_eq_0.png

All in all, the static schedulers perform poorly when it comes to shut hosts down, and the reconfigurator performs very well, especially with a short delay.

@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_migrations Observing the migrations

However, reconfigurations imply VM migrations, that consume resources as well.
Let's look at the amount of migrations:
@code
TU_ARG --count_if vm.*state eq migrating
@endcode

\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slow.vm__state_eq_migrating.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator10_slow.vm__state_eq_migrating.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator100_slow.vm__state_eq_migrating.png

As one can see, with a delay of 0 seconds, there are up to 6 concurrent migrations, while with a delay of 10 secondes, only two migrations occured concurrently.


@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_dual_injections Using two injectors at once.

After the previous observations, the reconsolidator scheduler seems interresting, particularly with a short delay.

Let's look at the results with a different load.
To do so, one can add another injector configuration file *injector-fast.xml* and add the simulations in the lab

@code 
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE injectors>
<injectors>
 </injector> 
  <injector id="myInjectorFast"
   class="org.simgrid.schiaas.loadinjector.injectors.SinInjector"
   cloud="myCloud">
  <config 
   start_date="0"
   duration="2000"
   period="3"
   instance_period="60"
   instance_min="128"
   instance_max="192"
   load_period="100"
   load_min="90"
   load_max="100"
   image_id="myImage"
   instance_type_id="small-dp30"
  />
 </injector> 
</injectors>
@endcode

@code
SIM_ARG 1 loadinjector.SimpleInjection
SIM_ARG 2 platform.xml 
SIM_ARG 3 deploy.xml
SIM_ARG 4:balancer cloud-balancer.xml
SIM_ARG 4:consolidator cloud-consolidator.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator0 cloud-reconsolidator0.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator10 cloud-reconsolidator10.xml 
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator100 cloud-reconsolidator100.xml
SIM_ARG 5:slow injector-slow.xml 
SIM_ARG 5:fast injector-fast.xml 
@endcode


Or alternatively, one can combine the two injections into one simulation with *injector-slowfast.xml*.

@code 
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE injectors>
<injectors>

 <injector id="myInjectorSlow"
  class="org.simgrid.schiaas.loadinjector.injectors.SinInjector"
  cloud="myCloud">
  <config 
   start_date="0"
   duration="2000"
   period="3"
   instance_period="1000"
   instance_min="10"
   instance_max="192"
   load_period="100"
   load_min="90"
   load_max="100"
   image_id="myImage"
   instance_type_id="small-dp30"
  />
 </injector> 

 <injector id="myInjectorFast"
   class="org.simgrid.schiaas.loadinjector.injectors.SinInjector"
   cloud="myCloud">
  <config 
   start_date="2000"
   duration="2000"
   period="3"
   instance_period="60"
   instance_min="128"
   instance_max="192"
   load_period="100"
   load_min="90"
   load_max="100"
   image_id="myImage"
   instance_type_id="small-dp30"
  />
 </injector> 

</injectors>
@endcode

@code
SIM_ARG 1 loadinjector.SimpleInjection
SIM_ARG 2 platform.xml 
SIM_ARG 3 deploy.xml
SIM_ARG 4:balancer cloud-balancer.xml
SIM_ARG 4:consolidator cloud-consolidator.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator0 cloud-reconsolidator0.xml
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator10 cloud-reconsolidator10.xml 
SIM_ARG 4:reconsolidator100 cloud-reconsolidator100.xml
SIM_ARG 5:slowfast injector-slowfast.xml 
@endcode

As one can see, following the previous injection, there is now a second injection with a much more agressive *intance_period*. This simulate a large number of users creating and terminating VM all the time:
\image html xp_balancer_slowfast.instances_count.png

Now, let's look at the number of busy hosts with reconsolidator 0 and 10 :
\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slowfast.used_cores_ne_0.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator10_slowfast.used_cores_ne_0.png

Under agressive loads, those actually perform worse than the simple consolidator:
\image html xp_consolidator_slowfast.used_cores_ne_0.png

This is confirmed by the integrals of the number of busy hosts over time:
\image html busy_hosts-integral-slow.png
\image html busy_hosts-integral-fast.png


This is explained by the amount of migrations that slow the platform down:

\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slowfast.vm__state_eq_migrating.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator10_slowfast.vm__state_eq_migrating.png
\image html xp_reconsolidator100_slowfast.vm__state_eq_migrating.png

Actually, with a delay of 0, there are so many migrations that some vms can not be ran:
\image html xp_reconsolidator0_slowfast.vm__state_eq_running.png


@subsection howto_scheduler_observing_closely Observing more closely

As raw data from observations are not sufficient, data can be easily imported into R:
@code
$ R
> library(traceutil)
> tu_read('./data')
@endcode

Afterward, the observations can be manipulated directly:
@code 
> head(xp_balancer_slow.used_cores_ne_0)
      entity     date value
1 used_cores    0.000    24
2 used_cores 2004.008     0
@endcode

Some additional functionalities are available in the library traceutil.
For instance, it allows to integrate values of the observation over time, and apply a given function to all observed XPs at once:
@code
> ??traceutil
>
> ?tu_integrate
> tu_integrate(xp_balancer_slow.used_cores_ne_0)

And everything can be automatized with template.R, as declared in the lab configuration file:
@code
library(traceutil)

pdf('data.pdf')
tu_read(plotting=TRUE)
dev.off()


pdf('busy_hosts-integral.pdf')
uc <-tu_apply(xps,'used_cores_ne_0',tu_integrate)
barplot(uc$value, names.arg=uc$xp)
uc
dev.off()
@endcode

After running lab.sh:
- *data/R.out* will contain the result of the execution of R;
- *data/data.pdf* will contain the plot of every observation;
- *data/busy_hosts-integral.pdf* will contain the specific plot:
